Dear Hiring Manager,

I noticed your Senior Backend Engineer role emphasizes data integrity and
security. I've prepared a technical walkthrough of a fraud detection system
I built that might be relevant:

https://gist.github.com/michaelzrork/[fraud-detection-link]

This production system processes millions of records, uses multi-criteria
pattern analysis, and achieved zero false positives over 2+ years.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how this experience applies to
[Company Name]'s backend infrastructure.

Best regards,
Michael
```

## 📊 Gist Analytics & Engagement

After creating public gists, you can:
- **Star your own gists** to feature them
- **See view counts** (public gists only)
- **Allow comments** to demonstrate openness to feedback
- **Fork detection** if others reuse your patterns

### Making Gists More Discoverable

Add **tags in description:**
```
Automated fraud detection using Progress ABL.

Tags: #fraud-detection #pattern-matching #database-automation
#backend-engineering #production-security #abl #progress
```

GitHub will index these for search.

## 🎨 Gist Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use **descriptive filenames** (`fraud-detection-system.md`, not `script1.md`)
- Include **business impact** metrics (time saved, error reduction)
- Add **"Why this matters"** context for non-ABL developers
- Show **before/after** comparisons
- Include **interview talking points** (ready-to-use STAR stories)
- Add **code comments** explaining business logic

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share **proprietary business logic** (use sanitized examples)
- Include **customer data** (even in comments!)
- Use **company-specific terminology** without explanation
- Assume reader knows **Progress ABL syntax** (explain patterns)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Create a Gist Collection Page
Create a main gist that links to others:

**Filename:** `database-automation-portfolio.md`
```markdown
# Database Automation Portfolio

Collection of production scripts demonstrating backend engineering capabilities.

## 🔐 Security & Fraud Prevention
[Automated Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://gist.github.com/...)
- Multi-criteria pattern analysis
- Zero false positives over 2+ years
- 80% reduction in manual review time

## 🏗️ System Architecture
[Multi-Step Workflow Orchestration](https://gist.github.com/...)
- API integration vs. direct database access
- Stateful workflow management
...
```

Share this collection link on your resume!

### 2. Update Gists Over Time
- Add **"Update (Jan 2025):"** sections with new learnings
- Shows continuous growth mindset
- Demonstrates reflection on past work

### 3. Cross-Link Gists
In each gist, add a footer:
```markdown
---
**Other Technical Deep-Dives:**
- [Metaprogramming Framework](link)
- [Data Quality System](link)
- [View All](link-to-collection)
```

### 4. Add Visual Diagrams (Optional)
Use ASCII art or embed images:
```
┌─────────────┐
│   Account   │
│  (Household)│
└──────┬──────┘
       │ 1:many
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ Relationship│
│ (Join Table)│
└──────┬──────┘
       │ 1:1
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Member    │
│(Family Mbr) │
└─────────────┘
```
