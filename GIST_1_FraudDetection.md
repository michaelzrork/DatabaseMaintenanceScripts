# Automated Credit Card Fraud Detection System
## InactivateBadActorHHs_Today-7.p

**Language:** Progress ABL (4GL)
**Lines of Code:** 870
**Purpose:** Automated detection and inactivation of fraudulent household accounts created for credit card testing

---

## Business Problem

SaaS membership platform was experiencing:
- Bad actors creating fake household accounts to test stolen credit cards
- Hundreds of declined transactions per day causing payment processor fees
- Manual review taking 10+ hours per week
- Risk of account suspension from payment processor due to chargeback ratios

## Solution Overview

Built multi-criteria fraud detection engine that analyzes:
- **Email patterns** (fake domains like @example.com, known bad actor emails)
- **Name patterns** (gibberish like "asd", "sdf", "fdg")
- **Birthday patterns** (learning from known fraudulent accounts)
- **Transaction behavior** (declined transactions with cardholder name mismatches)
- **Address validation** (missing GPS coordinates indicate invalid addresses)
- **User agent analysis** (WebTrac interface vs. internal transactions)

**Key Achievement:** Zero false positives through layered validation approach

---

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Dynamic Date Calculation
```progress
/* Extract number of days from filename at runtime */
find last ActivityLog where
    ActivityLog.SourceProgram = "QuickFixProcessor"
    and ActivityLog.Detail1 matches "*InactivateBadActorHHs*Today-*"

StartPosition = index(ActivityLog.Detail1,"Today-") + 6
/* Parse numeric suffix (e.g., "Today-7" → 7 days) */
if isNumeric(cDaysCheck) then iNumDays = int(cDaysCheck)
CheckDate = today - iNumDays
```
**Why this matters:** Script is self-configuring based on filename—no hardcoded dates

### 2. Temp-Table Pattern Learning
```progress
define temp-table ttBirthdays
    field Birthday as date
    index Birthday Birthday.

/* Add known bad actor birthdays */
create ttBirthdays.
ttBirthdays.Birthday = 12/31/1969.

/* Learn new patterns from @example.com households */
if Account.PrimaryEmailAddress matches "*@example*" then
    if Member.Birthday <> ? then
        find first ttBirthdays where ttBirthdays.Birthday = Member.Birthday no-error.
        if not available ttBirthdays then
            create ttBirthdays.
            ttBirthdays.Birthday = Member.Birthday.
```
**Why this matters:** System learns from confirmed fraud cases to catch new variations

### 3. False-Positive Prevention - Layered Validation

**Layer 1: Guaranteed Fraud (No false positives possible)**
```progress
/* Inactivate known bad actor email patterns */
if Account.PrimaryEmailAddress matches "*@example*"
   or Account.PrimaryEmailAddress = "marcelopinedaloia9222@gmail.com" then
    run InactivateHousehold("Known Bad Actor Email")
```

**Layer 2: Skip Internal Transactions**
```progress
/* Bad actor can only access WebTrac interface */
for first CardTransactionLog where
    CardTransactionLog.ParentRecord = Account.ID
    and lookup(CardTransactionLog.UserName, WebTracUserNames) = 0:
    run LogHousehold("Internal Purchase Found - Legitimate")
    next hh-loop. /* SKIP THIS HOUSEHOLD */
```

**Layer 3: Gibberish Name Detection**
```progress
if Account.FirstName begins "asd" or Account.LastName begins "asd"
   or Account.FirstName begins "asf" or Account.LastName begins "sdf" then
    run InactivateHousehold("Gibberish Name Pattern")
```

**Layer 4: Address Validation**
```progress
/* Legitimate households have geocoded addresses */
if index(Account.MiscInformation, "HouseholdCoordinates") > 0 then
    run LogHousehold("Valid Address - Legitimate")
    next hh-loop. /* SKIP */
```

**Layer 5: Birthday Pattern Matching**
```progress
find first ttBirthdays where ttBirthdays.Birthday = Member.Birthday no-error.
if available ttBirthdays then
    run InactivateHousehold("Birthday Matches Known Bad Actor Pattern")
```

**Layer 6: Cardholder Name Analysis**
```progress
/* Check declined transaction cardholder name against family members */
for first CardTransactionLog where
    CardTransactionLog.RecordStatus = "Declined":

    for each ttFMName where ttFMName.HHID = Account.ID:
        /* If cardholder name matches any family member → LEGITIMATE */
        if index(CardTransactionLog.CreditCardholder, ttFMName.FirstName) > 0
           or index(CardTransactionLog.CreditCardholder, ttFMName.LastName) > 0 then
            run LogHousehold("Cardholder Name Matches - Legitimate")
            next hh-loop. /* SKIP */
    end.

    /* No name match + declined transaction = FRAUD */
    run InactivateHousehold("Declined Transaction with Name Mismatch")
```

### 4. Comprehensive Logging for Audit Trail

```progress
run put-stream (
    "Log Notes," +
    "HH Number," +
    "HH ID," +
    "Card Holder Name," +
    "HH Creation Date," +
    "CCHist Record Status," +
    "CCHist Amount," +
    /* ... 25+ fields logged */
)
```

Every decision (inactivate OR skip) is logged with full context for manual review.

### 5. Refund Detection
```progress
procedure checkForSettled:
    /* Log all settled transactions for inactivated households */
    for each CardTransactionLog where
        CardTransactionLog.ParentRecord = inpID
        and CardTransactionLog.RecordStatus = "Settled":
        run LogHousehold("Settled Transaction - Refund May Be Required")
```
**Why this matters:** Finance team gets actionable list of transactions to review for refunds

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Temp-table caching** - Family member names cached to avoid repeated DB queries
2. **Early exit patterns** - Skips households as soon as legitimacy confirmed
3. **Indexed queries** - Uses `use-index ID` for ActivityLog lookup
4. **Batch processing** - 100K record chunks for CSV output

---

## Production Safeguards

### LogOnly Mode
```progress
LogOnly = if {&ProgramName} matches "*LogOnly*" then true else false

if LogOnly then
    /* Write to log but don't actually inactivate */
else
    find first bufAccount exclusive-lock where bufAccount.ID = hhID
    bufAccount.RecordStatus = "Inactive"
```

### Real-time Progress Tracking
```progress
run UpdateActivityLog(
    {&ProgramDescription} + " as of " + string(CheckDate),
    "Program in Progress; Last Record ID - Account: " + string(Account.ID),
    "Number of Households Inactivated: " + string(numRecs),
    "Number of Households Skipped: " + string(numHHSkipped)
)
```
Allows monitoring of script progress and provides restart checkpoint if needed.
