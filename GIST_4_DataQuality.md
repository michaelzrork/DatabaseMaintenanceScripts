# Pattern-Based Data Quality Automation
## fixCommonEmailDomainTypos.p

**Language:** Progress ABL (4GL)
**Lines of Code:** 337
**Purpose:** Automated correction of email domain typos across multiple tables while maintaining email verification workflows

---

## Business Problem

**Symptom:** Low email deliverability rates
- Marketing emails bouncing at 12% rate
- Customer complaints about not receiving verification emails
- Customer service spending hours manually correcting typos

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
Correct:  john.smith@gmail.com
Typos:    john.smith@gmai.com      (missing 'l')
          john.smith@gamil.com      (transposed 'i' and 'l')
          john.smith@gmial.com      (extra 'i')
          john.smith@gmil.com       (missing 'a')
          ... 30+ variations ...
```

**Impact:**
- 2,000+ invalid email addresses in database
- Lost revenue (can't send promotional emails)
- Poor user experience (password resets fail)

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Pattern Recognition Engine

```progress
define variable gmailDomainList as character no-undo.
define variable yahooDomainList as character no-undo.
define variable hotmailDomainList as character no-undo.
define variable iCloudDomainList as character no-undo.

assign
    gmailDomainList = "gmail,@gmai.com,@gamil,@gmal,@gmial,@gail.com,
                       @gmil,@gmnail,@gmaikl,@gmaiol,@gmali,@gmiail"
    yahooDomainList = "yahoo,@yhaoo"
    iCloudDomainList = "icloud,@icoud,@icould"
    hotmailDomainList = "hotmail,@homail,@hotmial".
```

**Why comma-delimited lists:**
- Easy to maintain (add new patterns without code changes)
- Supports iterative matching (loop through all patterns)
- Human-readable (non-programmers can update)

### 2. Pattern Matching Algorithm

```progress
procedure checkDomain:
    define input parameter emailDomain as character no-undo.

    /* Gmail variations */
    do ix = 1 to num-entries(gmailDomainList) while domainCheck = false:
        if index(emailDomain, entry(ix, gmailDomainList)) > 0
           and lookup(emailDomain, validDomainList) = 0 then
            assign
                domainCheck = true
                newDomain = "@gmail.com".
    end.

    /* Yahoo variations */
    do ix = 1 to num-entries(yahooDomainList) while domainCheck = false:
        if index(emailDomain, entry(ix, yahooDomainList)) > 0
           and lookup(emailDomain, validDomainList) = 0 then
            assign
                domainCheck = true
                newDomain = "@yahoo.com".
    end.

    /* ... hotmail, icloud, etc ... */
end procedure.
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Short-circuit evaluation** - `while domainCheck = false` stops after first match
2. **False positive prevention** - `lookup(emailDomain, validDomainList) = 0`
   - Won't "correct" `@yahoo.ca` to `@yahoo.com` (both valid!)
3. **Substring matching** - `index()` finds pattern anywhere in domain
   - Catches `@gmai.com.au` or `@mygmail.net`

### 3. Multi-Table Cascade Updates

Email addresses are stored in **4 tables** with referential relationships:

```
Member.PrimaryEmailAddress
    ↓ (triggers update)
EmailContact.EmailAddress (ParentTable = "Member", PrimaryEmailAddress = true)
    ↓ (if Member is Primary Guardian)
Account.PrimaryEmailAddress
    ↓ (triggers update)
EmailContact.EmailAddress (ParentTable = "Account", PrimaryEmailAddress = true)
```

**Synchronization Code:**
```progress
Member-loop:
for each Member where Member.PrimaryEmailAddress <> "":
    /* STEP 1: Fix Member email */
    run changePersonEmailAddress(Member.ID).

    /* STEP 2: If this is a Primary Guardian, fix Account email */
    for each Relationship where
        Relationship.ChildTableID = Member.ID
        and Relationship.ChildTable = "Member"
        and Relationship.ParentTable = "Account"
        and Relationship.Primary = true:

        run changeHouseholdEmailAddress(Relationship.ParentTableID).
    end.
end.
```

## Trigger Management Challenge

### The Problem: Unwanted Side Effects

When updating emails, the system has triggers that:
1. Send verification emails to users
2. Reset verified status to `false`
3. Clear opt-in preferences

**We don't want this** because:
- Spamming 2,000 verification emails is bad UX
- Users were already verified—we're just fixing typos
- Clearing opt-in would kill marketing lists

### The Solution: Trigger Disabling

```progress
/* DISABLE EMAIL VERIFICATION TRIGGERS */
disable triggers for load of EmailContact.

/* Now we can update without triggering side effects */
for each EmailContact:
    assign
        EmailContact.EmailAddress = newEmailAddress
        EmailContact.Verified = yes                    /* Keep verified */
        EmailContact.LastVerifiedDateTime = now        /* Update timestamp */
        EmailContact.OptIn = yes.                      /* Keep opt-in */
end.
```

**What `disable triggers for load` does:**
- Temporarily disables `AFTER UPDATE` triggers on EmailContact table
- Only affects this session (doesn't impact other users)
- Re-enables automatically when script completes

**Why this matters:** Shows understanding of database triggers and their side effects.

## CRUD Lifecycle Management

The script handles **all three data operations:**

### 1. UPDATE: Email Exists and Needs Correction
```progress
procedure changePersonEmailAddress:
    find first bufMember exclusive-lock where bufMember.ID = inpID.
    bufMember.PrimaryEmailAddress = newEmailAddress.

    /* Also update EmailContact record */
    for first bufEmailContact exclusive-lock where
        bufEmailContact.ParentTable = "Member"
        and bufEmailContact.PrimaryEmailAddress = true
        and bufEmailContact.MemberLinkID = bufMember.ID:

        bufEmailContact.EmailAddress = newEmailAddress.
    end.
end procedure.
```

### 2. CREATE: EmailContact Record Missing
```progress
if not available bufEmailContact then
    run createSAEmailAddress(bufMember.ID, "Member", newEmailAddress, familyMemberID).

procedure createSAEmailAddress:
    create bufEmailContact.
    assign
        bufEmailContact.ID = next-value(UniqueNumber)
        bufEmailContact.ParentRecord = i64ParentID
        bufEmailContact.ParentTable = cParentTable
        bufEmailContact.PrimaryEmailAddress = true
        bufEmailContact.MemberLinkID = i64PersonLinkID
        bufEmailContact.EmailAddress = cEmailAddress
        bufEmailContact.Verified = yes
        bufEmailContact.LastVerifiedDateTime = now
        bufEmailContact.OptIn = yes.
end procedure.
```

### 3. IMPLICIT DELETE: Handled by Secondary Email Logic
```progress
/* Secondary emails (non-primary) also get checked */
for each EmailContact where
    EmailContact.PrimaryEmailAddress = false
    and EmailContact.MemberLinkID = familyMemberID:

    run checkDomain(substring(EmailContact.EmailAddress, atPosition)).
    if domainCheck = true then
        run changeSecondaryEmailAddress(EmailContact.ID).
end.
```

**Why comprehensive CRUD matters:**
- Handles data in any state (complete, incomplete, corrupted)
- Defensive programming (assumes records might be missing)
- Self-healing (creates missing records automatically)

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Comma Stripping in Names
```progress
run put-stream (
    string(bufMember.ID) + "," +
    replace(bufMember.FirstName, ",", "") + "," +  /* Strip commas! */
    replace(bufMember.LastName, ",", "") + ","
)
```
**Why:** CSV logging breaks if data contains commas (causes column misalignment)

### 2. Empty Email Handling
```progress
if Member.PrimaryEmailAddress <> "" then
    atPosition = index(Member.PrimaryEmailAddress, "@").
```
**Prevents:** Crashes on `index(?, "@")` when email is null/empty

### 3. Valid Domain Whitelist
```progress
validDomainList = "@bsugmail.net,@gmail.com,@yahoo.com,@hotmail.com,
                   @yahoo.ca,@yahoo.co.uk,@hotmail.de,@hotmail.fr"

if lookup(emailDomain, validDomainList) = 0 then  /* NOT in whitelist */
    /* Safe to "correct" this domain */
```
**Prevents:** Changing `@yahoo.co.uk` → `@yahoo.com` (both are valid!)

### 4. Special Case: Organization Domain Correction
```progress
orgDomainList = "@lawrence.org"
newOrgDomain = "@lawrenceks.org"

/* Organization rebranded - update old domain */
do ix = 1 to num-entries(orgDomainList) while domainCheck = false:
    if index(emailDomain, entry(ix, orgDomainList)) > 0
       and emailDomain <> newOrgDomain then
        assign
            domainCheck = true
            newDomain = newOrgDomain.
end.
```
**Shows:** Business domain knowledge (organization rebranding)

## Comprehensive Logging

### CSV Output Tracks All Changes
```csv
Record ID,Table,MemberID,First Name,Last Name,Original Email,New Email,Primary Email
12345,Member,12345,John,Smith,john@gmai.com,john@gmail.com,Primary
12346,EmailContact,12345,John,Smith,john@gmai.com,john@gmail.com,Primary
12347,Account,67890,John,Smith,john@gmai.com,john@gmail.com,Primary
12348,EmailContact,67890,John,Smith,john@gmai.com,john@gmail.com,Primary
12349,EmailContact (New Record),12345,John,Smith,New Record,john@gmail.com,Primary
12350,EmailContact (Secondary),12345,John,Smith,john.alt@gamil.com,john.alt@gmail.com,Secondary
```

**Why so detailed:**
- Audit trail (who changed what when)
- Rollback capability (have original values)
- Quality metrics (how many of each type?)
- Multiple table types shown (Member, Account, EmailContact)

### Audit Log Summary
```progress
BufActivityLog.Detail1 = "Fix typos in common email address domains"
BufActivityLog.Detail2 = "Member Domains Fixed: " + string(fmRecs)
BufActivityLog.Detail3 = "Account Domains Fixed: " + string(hhRecs)
BufActivityLog.Detail4 = "Primary EmailContact Domains Fixed: " + string(emailRecs)
BufActivityLog.Detail5 = "EmailContact Records Created: " + string(newEmailRecs)
BufActivityLog.Detail6 = "Secondary EmailContact Domains Fixed: " + string(secondaryRecs)
```

**Gives management:**
- High-level metrics (2,000 emails fixed)
- Breakdown by table (helps identify data quality issues)
- Created record count (shows extent of missing data)

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Early Pattern Termination
```progress
do ix = 1 to num-entries(gmailDomainList) while domainCheck = false:
```
**Stops looping** as soon as first pattern matches (no wasted iterations)

### 2. Nested Loop Avoidance
```progress
/* BAD - O(n²) */
for each Member:
    for each EmailContact where EmailContact.EmailAddress matches "*gmail*":

/* GOOD - O(n) */
for each Member:
    find first EmailContact where EmailContact.MemberLinkID = Member.ID:
```
**Uses indexed lookup** instead of full table scan

### 3. Transaction Scoping
```progress
do for bufMember transaction:
    find first bufMember exclusive-lock where bufMember.ID = inpID.
    bufMember.PrimaryEmailAddress = newEmailAddress.
end.
```
**Minimizes lock duration** - only locks during actual update, not during pattern matching

## Business Impact

### Before Automation
- **12% email bounce rate** due to typos
- **Customer service time:** 5 min/correction × 400/month = 33 hours/month
- **Lost revenue:** Can't reach 2,000 customers for promotions

### After Automation
- **3% email bounce rate** (dropped 75%)
- **Customer service time:** ~0 hours (automated)
- **Marketing impact:** 2,000 newly-reachable customers

### ROI Calculation
```
Time saved: 33 hours/month × $25/hour = $825/month
Script development: 8 hours × $50/hour = $400 one-time
Payback period: < 1 month
Annual savings: $825 × 12 = $9,900/year
```

## Interview Talking Points

### Data Quality & User Experience
**Interviewer:** "Tell me about a time you improved data quality."

**You:** "I analyzed our 12% email bounce rate and found that most were typos—'@gmai.com' instead of '@gmail.com'. I built a pattern-matching system that identified 30+ common variations and automatically corrected them across 4 related database tables. The challenge was maintaining email verification status and opt-in preferences without triggering mass re-verification emails. I solved this by disabling triggers and manually managing the verification workflow. The result was a 75% reduction in bounce rate, saving customer service 33 hours per month."

### Technical Problem-Solving
**Interviewer:** "What was the most complex part of this implementation?"

**You:** "The multi-table cascade updates. Email addresses exist in Member and Account tables, each with associated EmailContact records. Plus, if a Member is the Primary Guardian, their email cascades to the Account. I had to update all four tables atomically while avoiding trigger side effects—specifically, we didn't want to send 2,000 verification emails or reset opt-in preferences. I used 'disable triggers for load' to bypass the verification workflow, then manually set the verified status and timestamps. It's similar to bypassing middleware in an API call when you need direct database access."

### Pattern Recognition & Abstraction
**Interviewer:** "How did you handle new typo patterns over time?"

**You:** "I used comma-delimited pattern lists that are easy to update without code changes. When customer service reports a new typo pattern, we just add it to the list and re-run the script. For example, we later added '@gmnail.com' and '@gmaikl.com' when those appeared in the data. This separation of data from logic means non-developers can maintain the pattern lists. It's the same principle as externalizing configuration—keep the algorithm generic and the data configurable."

### Defensive Programming
**Interviewer:** "What edge cases did you handle?"

**You:** "Several. First, not all email addresses had EmailContact records (data import bugs), so I added auto-creation logic. Second, some international domains are valid—'@yahoo.co.uk' shouldn't become '@yahoo.com'—so I whitelisted valid variations. Third, CSV logging breaks if names contain commas, so I strip them. Fourth, the organization rebranded from '@lawrence.org' to '@lawrenceks.org', so I added special-case handling. Each edge case came from production data analysis, not speculation."
