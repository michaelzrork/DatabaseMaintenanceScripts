**Purpose:** Identify stolen credit card testing patterns in real-time registration systems

**Business Impact:** Enabled 8+ organizations to restore merchant accounts shut down by fraudulent activity

**Technical Implementation:**

**Multi-Factor Risk Analysis:**
The algorithm analyzes multiple risk indicators to identify fraudulent accounts:

1. **Registration Timing Patterns**
   - Rapid sequential account creation (timing clusters)
   - Configurable lookback period (filename-based: Today-7, Today-1, etc.)
   - Self-extracting date range from audit logs

2. **Naming Pattern Detection**
   - Known fraudulent name patterns (e.g., names starting with "asd")
   - Email address validation (@example.com domains flagged)
   - Known bad actor email addresses

3. **Payment Analysis**
   - Credit card decline patterns
   - Card holder name vs. family member name matching
   - Settled vs. declined transaction ratios
   - Payment method restrictions (in-house vs. online)

4. **Geographic & Demographic Validation**
   - Household coordinate checking (valid addresses vs. fake)
   - Birthday pattern matching (12/31/1969 as common test value)
   - Address validation logic

5. **Transaction History Correlation**
   - Cross-references settled transactions for refund logging
   - Generates detailed CSV reports with all transaction data
   - Links fraudulent accounts across multiple criteria

**Key Features:**
- **Configurable lookback period** - Filename-based date range (e.g., `Today-7.p` checks last 7 days)
- **Self-configuring** - Reads its own filename from audit logs to determine date range
- **Low false-positive rate** - Multiple validation layers prevent legitimate user flagging
- **Production safety** - LogOnly mode for validation before execution

### 2. Duplicate Family Member Merger
**Filename:** **[mergeDuplicateFMs.p](https://github.com/michaelzrork/DatabaseMaintenanceScripts/blob/main/Scripts/mergeDuplicateFMs.p)**

**Purpose:** Merge duplicate member records within the same household while maintaining all relationship data

**Business Challenge:** 
Customer databases accumulated duplicate family members due to:
- Multiple registration channels (web, phone, in-person)
- Staff data entry errors
- Self-service registration duplication
- Parent vs. guardian registration conflicts

**Technical Implementation:**

**Matching Logic:**
Identifies duplicates based on:
- First name + last name + birth date (exact match)
- Within same household only (prevents incorrect merges)
- Active status validation (preserves current data)

**Merge Strategy:**
1. **Record Selection:**
   - Identifies all duplicate sets within household
   - Selects primary record (most complete data, most recent activity)
   - Queues secondary records for merge

2. **Relationship Preservation:**
   - Transfers all foreign key relationships to primary record
   - Updates activity history links
   - Maintains registration enrollments
   - Preserves financial transaction history

3. **Data Consolidation:**
   - Merges custom field data
   - Combines membership history
   - Preserves all activity log entries
   - Updates cross-reference tables

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Marks secondary records inactive
   - Links duplicate records for audit trail
   - Logs all merge operations
   - Generates comprehensive CSV report

**Safety Features:**
- Dry-run mode (review before execution)
- Within-household-only merging (prevents cross-household errors)
- Comprehensive logging (audit trail for all changes)
- Validation checks (prevents data loss)
- Transaction-wrapped (rollback on error)

**Code Structure (542 lines):**
```
Lines 1-98:   Configuration and validation setup
Lines 99-215: Duplicate identification logic
Lines 216-398: Relationship transfer procedures
Lines 399-495: Data merge operations
Lines 496-542: Cleanup and logging
```

**Production Results:**
- Cleaned up hundreds of duplicate member records
- Restored data integrity for enrollment systems
- Enabled accurate household relationship tracking
- Simplified user account management

**Iterative Improvements:**
- Initially merge all duplicates - changed to confirm before merge
- Added validation for primary member selection
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
- Added revert capability for incorrect merges

**Impact:** Cleaned household data, improved registration accuracy, simplified account management for staff.

### 3. Email Synchronization System
**Filename:** **[syncHHEmailtoPrimaryGuardian.p](https://github.com/michaelzrork/DatabaseMaintenanceScripts/blob/main/Scripts/syncHHEmailtoPrimaryGuardian.p)**

**Purpose:** Ensure household-level email addresses match the primary guardian's email

**Business Context:**
The RecTrac system maintains emails at two levels:
- **Household level** - Used for billing, account notifications
- **Member level** - Individual email addresses for each family member

When the primary guardian's email changes, the household email should automatically sync. However, edge cases caused synchronization failures:
- Direct database updates bypassing application logic
- Legacy data migration issues
- Multiple simultaneous updates
- Email verification status mismatches

**Technical Implementation:**

**Sync Strategy:**
1. **Identify Out-of-Sync Records:**
   - Find households where primary guardian email â‰  household email
   - Exclude households with intentionally different emails
   - Skip households with no primary guardian

2. **Validation:**
   - Verify primary guardian relationship code
   - Check email format validity
   - Confirm household email isn't manually set

3. **Update Process:**
   - Copy primary guardian email â†’ household email
   - Update email verification status
   - Update opt-in/opt-out status
   - Log all changes

4. **Post-Sync Verification:**
   - Confirm sync completed
   - Log any failures
   - Generate summary report

**Safety Features:**
- Read-only on Account records (no accidental household changes)
- Comprehensive logging of all syncs
- Preserves email history
- No data deletion (only updates)

**Code Structure (197 lines):**
```
Lines 1-59:  Configuration and logging setup
Lines 60-79: Main sync loop
Lines 80-197: Email update procedures with field-level changes
```

**Production Results:**
- Fixed hundreds of out-of-sync email records
- Prevented communication issues
- Restored email verification accuracy
- Used as post-update maintenance step

**Iterative Improvements:**
- Originally deleted member emails when household email blank
- Updated to sync instead (preserves data)
- Added opt-in status sync
- Added verification status sync
- Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

**Impact:** Restored email data consistency, prevented communication failures, enabled reliable email verification tracking.
