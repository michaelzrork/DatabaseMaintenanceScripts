## Summary

Comprehensive sanitization of all 175 Progress ABL scripts to remove vendor-specific naming conventions and replace with generic database terminology.

## Changes Overview

### Table Name Mappings (23 tables)
- `SAHousehold` â†’ `Account`
- `SAPerson` â†’ `Member`
- `SAEmailAddress` â†’ `EmailContact`
- `SALink` â†’ `Relationship`
- `SAFee` â†’ `Charge`
- `SAFeeHistory` â†’ `ChargeHistory`
- `SADetail` â†’ `TransactionDetail`
- `SAReceipt` â†’ `PaymentReceipt`
- `SAReceiptpayment` â†’ `PaymentTransaction`
- `SAControlAccountHistory` â†’ `AccountBalanceLog`
- Plus 13 additional table mappings

### Procedure Name Updates (50+ procedures)
- `SetSALink` â†’ `SetRelationship`
- `createSAEmailaddress` â†’ `createEmailContact`
- `deleteSA*` â†’ `delete*` (table-specific)
- `updateSA*` â†’ `update*` (table-specific)
- `syncHouseholdEmail` â†’ `syncAccountEmail`
- Plus 45+ additional procedure renames

### Business Logic References
- `Business/HouseholdMerge.p` â†’ `Business/MergeAccounts.p /* External business logic API */`
- `Business/SADetailFeeCalc.p` â†’ `Business/CalculateTransactionTotal.p /* External calculation service */`
- `Business/DeleteSACriteria.p` â†’ `Business/DeleteFilter.p /* External filter deletion service */`
- `Business/SpecialSessionEnd.p` â†’ `Business/EndSession.p /* External session management */`

### Variable & Loop Updates
- Loop labels: `salink-loop` â†’ `relationship-loop`, `saxref-loop` â†’ `entitylink-loop`
- Buffer names: `bufSAhousehold` â†’ `bufAccount`, `bufChildSALink` â†’ `bufChildRelationship`
- Variables: `hhID` â†’ `accountID`, `fmID` â†’ `memberID`, `mergeHHnum` â†’ `mergeAccountNum`
- Plus dozens of counter and variable names updated

### Documentation Updates
- Updated all file headers and comments
- Sanitized inline comments referencing old table names
- Updated procedure documentation

## Verification

âœ… **Zero vendor-specific references remaining** (verified with grep)
âœ… **All 175 .p files processed successfully**
âœ… **Business logic references marked as external APIs**

## Files Changed

- **Modified:** 175 Progress ABL (.p) files
- **Deleted:** 6 GIST documentation files (to be recreated after manual code attribution review)
- **Total changes:** 706 insertions(+), 2,964 deletions(-)

## Impact

This sanitization makes the repository completely vendor-agnostic and suitable for:
- Public portfolio/resume demonstration
- Code sharing without proprietary terminology
- Technical documentation and walkthroughs
- Open discussion of implementation patterns

## Testing

All changes were systematic find-and-replace operations across well-defined naming patterns. No functional logic was alteredâ€”only identifiers and comments were updated.

## Notes

- GIST documentation files were removed and will be recreated after manual code attribution review
- `setData/getData` functions kept as-is (generic enough, not vendor-specific)
- Business logic program references now include comments marking them as external APIs
